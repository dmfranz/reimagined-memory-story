This is a story about me and my gangsters Mick, Eddie and Jeremy.  
We were vibing  at Pauls.

Not a phone in sight, just straight vibing; the gangsters and I
lay on the couches talking about our lives. We each had hopes
for the coming year: prosperous thugging, riches beyond our
wildest dreams, and, of course, even greater vibes. Suddenly,
Mick sat up with an alarmed look on his face. Concerned, we all
jumped up immediately too to see what was the matter. To our
horror, our worst nightmare was confirmed...
